here are some functions i think i might need in the future.
hope you find them useful, too.

functions #0:
join the strings with delimeter string 'delim' , the last string MUST BE 'NULL'
return buf.
this function has no SAFETY check, buf must be BIG ENOUGH.

strjoin(char *buf, char *delim, "string1", "string2", "string3", ..., NULL)
